# PHPThis application skeleton

This is the minimal checked starting point for an application built with PHPThis. It exposes one explicit route, `GET /health`, and contains project-owned AI context, behavior tests, the application-owned terminal request-summary path, and the complete consumer validity gate.

PHPThis uses AI-first authoring with human accountability. After installation, ask the AI working in this project how the application works or request the next feature. It must begin with `AGENTS.md`, the installed PHPThis contract and knowledge map, this application's `.ai/` context, and the concrete source and tests. PHPThis does not use a traditional framework manual as the primary learning interface.

A useful first request is:

> Read `AGENTS.md`, inspect the installed PHPThis version, explain the current request path with file references, and identify the project facts I must decide before we add the first feature.

## Create a new application

Use the published Composer project. Consumers do not clone or copy the PHPThis framework repository.

```bash
composer create-project --stability=alpha phpthis/skeleton my-app
cd my-app
composer check
```

This creates the application root from `phpthis/skeleton` and installs `phpthis/framework` under `vendor/phpthis/framework`.

Package availability is an external fact: verify tagged repositories and Packagist rather than inferring publication from this tracked README.

## Install and check an existing application checkout

```bash
composer install
composer check
```

`composer check` first runs the framework-owned Strict Profile and maximum-level PHPStan configuration, then runs the application's automated behavior tests. This starter's zero-dependency `tests/run.php` is one concrete implementation, not a required framework, filename, or directory. Every observable behavior change must add or update automated tests; the application remains free to choose its test library, runner, and file placement.
Commit the generated `composer.lock` with the application so dependency versions remain reproducible.

## Run locally

```bash
php -d error_reporting=-1 -d display_errors=0 -d display_startup_errors=0 -d log_errors=1 -d zend.exception_ignore_args=1 -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

The starter's sole front controller uses code-owned `GENERIC` outer-failure disclosure: a bootstrap, composition, or coordinator exception returns the fixed generic `500`, never PHP's native exception page. The starter does not read a debug or environment toggle and does not adopt detailed exception output. The explicit local command disables native error display and trace arguments while retaining PHP error logging on the operator-controlled terminal; every deployed web SAPI must prove equivalent effective settings separately.

Before adding product behavior, replace this skeleton's generic project facts in `.ai/` with facts verified for the real application.

Every coordinator-selected response carries an application-generated 128-bit lowercase-hex `X-Request-ID`; a pre-coordinator outer failure has no correlation or terminal-summary guarantee. The visible front-controller path makes exactly one attempt to send a closed redacted terminal summary to its application-owned sink; sink failure cannot alter the response, and an invocation attempt is not a durable-delivery guarantee. Database adoption uses a finite list of distinct budget and trace sources without changing the framework into a logger or SQL abstraction.

The AI may implement routine, in-scope work under human direction. It must surface consequential product, architecture, security, data, migration, deployment, and external-side-effect choices for human judgment. The human accepts those decisions and remains accountable for the result.
